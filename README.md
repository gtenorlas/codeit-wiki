## ðŸš€ About Me
Welcome to my Github page! My name is Gene Tenorlas and I'm a  full-stack developer. I'm thrilled to be on this platform, connecting with other developers and learning from the incredible talent here.

I have always been passionate about technology, but it wasn't until I started learning to code that I truly found my calling. There's something so satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into a tangible product that can make a difference in people's lives.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors. I love hiking, camping, and going on long bike rides. There's something about being in nature that clears my mind and helps me focus on my work.

One of my favorite things about programming is that it's constantly evolving, which means there's always something new to learn. I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skill set.

I'm excited to be part of the Github community and look forward to collaborating with other developers on exciting projects. Let's build something great together!
